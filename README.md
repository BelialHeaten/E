# Fire-Emblem-Discord-Bot
A Javascript Discord bot simulating a Fire Emblem-like turn-based strategical RPG

# Setting up your version of the bot
- [Follow the guide on how to setup a Discord.js bot up to the "Adding your bot to servers" part](https://discordjs.guide/)
- At the root of the project's folder, create a `config.json` file containing the following, with your own values:
```
{
    "prefix": "your-prefix",
    "token": "your-token-goes-there"
}
```
